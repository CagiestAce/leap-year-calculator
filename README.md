# Leap Year Finder

<p>This JavaScript script finds and prints all leap years between the years 2000 and 3000. A leap year is determined based on the following rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.</li>
    <li>However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.</li>
</ul>

## How It Works

<ol>
    <li>The script sets a starting year (ano) of 2000 and an ending year (anoFinal) of 3000.</li>
    <li>It then iterates through each year in this range.</li>
    <li>For each year, it checks if the year is a leap year using the rules mentioned above.</li>
    <li>If the year is a leap year, it prints the year to the console.</li>
</ol>
